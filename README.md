# Life-satisfaction-SEM

This project was an independent research endeavor focusing on the mediation of collectivism's impact on life satisfaction through impression management and perfectionism. To determine the necessary sample size, a power analysis was conducted aiming for 80% statistical power, with an effect size of 0.1, which indicated a need for a sample of 127. Data collection was primarily conducted by me as the researcher. 

The confirmatory analysis included screening for univariate and multivariate outliers, descriptive statistics, and a confirmatory factor analysis to construct an error-free measurement model with latent constructs. This was followed by a latent structural equation model and single regression SEMs. Supplementary methods were utilized to address issues related to model convergence. 

Exploratory analysis focused on examining differences in impression management between male and female samples. The normality of variable distribution was assessed using descriptive statistics, and an f-test was conducted to determine the homogeneity of variances across the samples.
